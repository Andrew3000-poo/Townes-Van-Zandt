  <p1> Live at the old quarter is an essential album to understanding Townes Van Zandt. All that encompasses the singer-songwriters persona is on full display in this compilation of Van Zandt’s five day stay at the Old Quarter. His iconic wit is exemplified not only in songs like “Franternaty Blues” and “Talking Thunderbird Blues”, but in his jokes before songs like “Two Girls” and “Rex’s Blues” where his cultlike audience recieves the jokes as the funniest things they’ve heard all night. Though one should not mistake him for a comedy act, much of Van Zandts appeal is the intuitive stories he weaves through songs such as “Poncho and Lefty” telling the tale of, as he puts it, “two cowboys [he] saw on T.V... two weeks after [he] wrote the song”, or in “Mr Mudd and Mr Gold” where, building upon the themes of five card poker, he tells a tale of a ruthless monarchy, and a “wretched fool” who is “made to pay” for the crime of being a derelict, wherein the queen recognises her long lost son as the wretched fool, saving his fate from the evil king. Ending the song powerfully with “if you feel like lost you’ll end up found / so amigo lay them raises down”, telling the audience that in spite of the despair presented in most of his songs (Waiting ‘Round to Die, Lungs and Dead Flowers to name a few that are have less than hopeful titles and themes) there is still a light at the end of the tunnel. Upon the points that I have raised about this album, it is also one of my favorites as it has got me through some of the hardest times of my life, and if it weren’t for the absolute honesty in the heartbreaking themes in his music, I would have had a much harder time contextualizing my situation.   </p1>
